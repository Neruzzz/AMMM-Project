# AMMM-Project
In this project, a problem similar to the travaling salesman problem (TSP) is mathematically formulated and solved using IBM's CPLEX and meta-heuristic algorithms as Greedy, GRASP or Local search implemented in python. This is the result of a month of work and its the final project of the AMMM (Algorithmic Methods for Mathematical Models) course of the MIRI master at UPC. An INSTRUCTIONS file is attached so anyone can use this repo.
